I'm a PhD student in Management & Organisational Behaviour working with {{< staticref "https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/bogdan-costea" "newtab" >}}Prof. Bogdan Costea{{< /staticref >}}, {{< staticref "https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/theodore-vurdubakis" "newtab" >}}Prof. Theodore Vurdubakis{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/peter-watt" "newtab" >}}Dr. Peter Watt{{< /staticref >}} at Lancaster University.

My research seeks to explore and understand the impact that the moral obligation to become the best version of oneself within the workplace can have on contemporary employees’ productivity and wellbeing. In a world consumed by positivity and potential, I seek to better appreciate the human psyche in work, by exploring how and why we have created a culture that encourages us to engage in a way of operating that, despite its optimistic exterior, leaves society feeling deficit and inadequate. 

I hold a MSc in Psychology (Distinction) from University of Nottingham, with a research dissertation exploring the relationship between smartphone addiction and mental health. Prior to this I gained a first-class BSc in Management and Organisational Behaviour from Lancaster University (top in my cohort). My undergraduate dissertation explored the dark(er) side of performance management in the HR department of a large UK pharmaceutical company. 

In between my undergraduate and postgraduate studies I was employed at Mars on their Management Development graduate programme for 3 years.
