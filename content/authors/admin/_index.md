I'm a PhD student in Management & Organisational Behaviour working with {{< staticref "https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lums/people/bogdan-costea" "newtab" >}}Prof. Bogdan Costea{{< /staticref >}} at Lancaster University.

I hold an MSc in Psychology from Lancaster University, where I worked in the {{< staticref "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d70cn93VP70" "newtab" >}}Nark Lab{{< /staticref >}} on [thesis topic]. Before this, I gained a BA in Management & Organisational Behaviour from Lancaster University, where I worked on [thesis topic].
